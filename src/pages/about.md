## About Us

Syzygy SF is a group of artists, musicians, makers, programmers and
more, who are building a creative community in San Francisco's
Mission district.

Our mission is to create a space where people from all backgrounds
can inspire each other, collaborate, and keep the spirit of all that
is weird and creative alive in SF.
