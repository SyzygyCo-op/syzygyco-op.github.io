## What Syzygy events could we find you at?
Hobby Hangs, various art things
How would you describe yourself in a sentence or less?
Tall. Not all that relevant, but less than a sentence.
The threshold for succinctness is now 4 letters

## What are some things that you've done so far that you're really proud of or really happy about?
Helped set up several art markets at Syzygy (was this things at Syzygy, or in general? oh well, proud of that in both cases I guess  :)

## What are some things you're excited about doing soon?
We should have another art market coming up soon (whenever "soon" is when this is read. "Soon")

## If people want to follow you online, where should they look?
nowhere, sadly. I try not to maintain a social media presence
