## What Syzygy events could we find you at?
Hobby Hangs, Movie Nights, and our occasional Art Shows and Markets

## How would you describe yourself in a sentence or less?
Art and Architecture Nerd - experimenting with alcohol inks and collage or researching obscure building details is bliss to me - though I can be lured out of my nerd spiral with cookies.

## What are some things that you've done so far that you're really proud of or really happy about?
I finally painted the Golden Gate Bridge! I surprised myself how much I enjoyed the process, and the end result.
I also completed a years-long quest to make a delicious fruit tart (thank you Julia Child)

## What are some things you're excited about doing soon?
I'm doing some home improvement projects and learning a lot - I have lots of stories about that adventure!
I'm also ready to embark on new cooking and baking adventures - hmu if you want to try a baking event at Syzygy!
